# Defense-against-Adversarial-Malware-using-RObust-Classifier-DAM-ROC
To develop a secure learning framework entitled, Defense against Adversarial Malware using RObust Classifier (DAM-ROC). The objective is to shield anti-malware entities against evasion attacks by making use of an adaptive adversarial training framework with novel retraining sample selector, (DAM-ROC OR) for Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based learners. Usage of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) along with possible quantification of predictive uncertainties is adapted. This generic framework, DAM-ROC is evaluated on benchmarked Android and Windows datasets to explore necessary trade-off between performance and robustness. DAM-ROC models are retrained to defend against gradient attacks like rBIMk, dBIMk, GRAMS and JSMA.
